# Homework Assignment 4

Open the [Assignment 4 Jupyter Notebook](assignment4.ipynb) and follow the instructions.

## Testing

If you would like to check to see if your solution is correct, run the following commands at the Terminal command line in sequence:

```bash
python test.py
```

a status message of `OK` means you have the correct solution.
